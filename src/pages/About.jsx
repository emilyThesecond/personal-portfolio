      <p>Hi! Welcome to my Portfolio, Im Emily.</p>
      <h6>My Journey Into loving Software engineer started when I was a little girl. Coding games in the computer lab sparked an interest that i carried for years, but felt i fell to short of that dream. Now, after years of self-doubt, I decided to dive into this amazing world. Being able to use my creativity, push myself to create innovative solutions, and always needing to learn more are elements that needed in a career, and that I got! I truley enjoy building and learning new things and I cant wait to keep gaining more knowledge. </h6>
      
      <h6>other things about me: </h6>
      <h6>I am a big hobby person, name any art or craft, I love. My second passion is pottery, (Hence my "Glaze Cookbook" app) although an expensive craft, like in coding, very fullfilling building something from scratch and calling it yours!</h6>
